Revised Plan for the Vacation Aid Project

Information Gathered:
The "VACATION AID PROJECT.pdf" outlines a web application aimed at connecting property hosts with customers seeking short-term housing. The core features include user authentication, property listing, booking management, and a messaging system. The project will now use Python for the backend with MySQL as the database, while the frontend will continue to utilize React.

Plan: Detailed Code Update Plan at File Level
1. Project Structure:
   - Create a new directory for the project.
   - Inside the project directory, create subdirectories for `frontend`, `backend`, and `database`.

2. Frontend Development:
   - Set up a React application using Create React App.
   - Install necessary libraries: React Router, Redux (or Context API), Tailwind CSS (or Material-UI).
   - Create components for:
     - User authentication (Sign Up / Log In)
     - Property listing and details
     - Booking management
     - Dashboards for hosts and customers
     - Messaging system
     - Reviews and ratings

3. Backend Development:
   - Set up a Python server using Flask or Django.
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for:
     - User authentication
     - Property management (CRUD operations)
     - Booking management
     - Messaging system
   - Use an ORM (like SQLAlchemy for Flask or Django ORM) to interact with the MySQL database.
   - Implement JWT or OAuth for authentication.

4. Database Design:
   - Design the database schema for users, properties, bookings, and messages.
   - Set up MySQL and create necessary tables.

5. Authentication:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT for stateless sessions.
   - Create middleware for protecting routes.

6. Deployment:
   - Choose hosting solutions:
     - Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
     - Backend: AWS EC2 or Heroku
     - Database: AWS RDS for MySQL.

7. Additional Features:
   - Plan for the integration of excursions, ride services, and flight booking.
   - Research APIs for ride services and flight booking.

Dependent Files to be Edited:
- No specific files to edit yet, as this is the initial setup phase. Future edits will depend on the implementation of the above features.

Followup Steps:
1. Set up the project structure and initialize version control with Git.
2. Begin frontend and backend development based on the outlined plan.
3. Test each component as it is developed.
4. Deploy the application to the chosen hosting platforms.
